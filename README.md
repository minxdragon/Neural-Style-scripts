# Neural-Style-scripts
a couple of shell scripts for using with JcJohnson's Neural-style
These are some automation scripts that work for sequencing images for animations and for batch processing a number of images at once. 
Install Neural Style here: https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style

Change Path information to your own neural style locations and add these scripts to your Neural style directory.

run by typing ‘bash Multiple_Images.sh’ or ‘bash Multiple_Images_Iterative.sh’

Multiple_Images will batch process a set of images. You can change the name and amount, if you have a lot of images it may be worth processing batches rather than the whole lot but ymmv. 

the second part shows the neural style parameters. all of this can be changed to your preferred settings, just remember to maintain the path information 

Multiple_Images_Iterative batch processes an animation while also changing the level of processing per image so that they increase in quality as the animation progresses. you can add to the number
